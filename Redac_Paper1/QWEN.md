# Quantum agrivoltaics research framework

## Overview

The quantum agrivoltaics research framework addresses the critical global challenge of sustainable land use and food-energy nexus by combining quantum physics with agronomy. Traditional agrivoltaic designs rely on classical models that optimize for Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) flux, treating light as a purely radiative input and crops as simple photon counters. This approach fundamentally neglects the quantum physical nature of photosynthetic energy transfer that operates with near-unity efficiency in natural systems.

The project specifically focuses on the comparative study of the Anderson model in weak and strong interaction regimes, implementing Process Tensor-HOPS with Low-Temperature Correction (PT-HOPS+LTC) as a breakthrough in non-Markovian quantum dynamics simulation. This enables realistic simulation of mesoscale photosynthetic systems (>1000 chromophores) essential for agrivoltaic applications.

## Theoretical foundation

### Background and motivation

The framework is grounded in the understanding that photosynthetic energy transfer (EET) operates as a quantum process governed by strong non-Markovian dynamics, where quantum coherence and structured environmental fluctuations play decisive roles. Seminal experimental and theoretical work has demonstrated that electronic coherences can persist on ultrafast and intermediate timescales in pigment-protein complexes, and that structured environmental interactions can assist energy transport under specific conditions.

The Fenna-Matthews-Olsen (FMO) complex of green sulfur bacteria serves as a paradigmatic system for understanding quantum effects in photosynthesis. This trimeric light-harvesting complex exhibits long-lived quantum coherences and has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally as a model system for quantum transport in biological environments. The FMO complex consists of 7-8 bacteriochlorophyll-a molecules per monomer, arranged to facilitate efficient energy transfer from the chlorosome antenna to the reaction center.

Recent advances in organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology have enabled the development of semi-transparent devices with controllable spectral transmission properties. These devices can be engineered to transmit specific wavelength ranges while harvesting the remainder for electrical power generation. The ability to tune transmission profiles opens the possibility of designing OPV materials that not only maximize power conversion efficiency but also optimize the quality of transmitted light for photosynthetic processes.

### Quantum dynamics framework

The quantum agrivoltaics framework employs a comprehensive non-Markovian quantum approach to model the coupled photosynthetic-photovoltaic system. The methodology treats the photosynthetic unit (PSU) as an open quantum system simultaneously coupled to both a structured vibrational environment and a spectrally filtered, non-thermal photon bath defined by the OPV panel's transmission function T(ω).

The dynamics of the reduced statistical operator ρ(t) for the excitonic system is governed by the quantum master equation:

dρ(t)/dt = L(t)ρ(t) = -i/ℏ [Ĥ_S, ρ(t)] + D[ρ(t)]

where Ĥ_S is the system Hamiltonian and D[ρ(t)] represents the dissipative terms due to system-bath interactions. The effective incident spectral density experienced by the PSU becomes J_plant(ω) = T(ω) × J_solar(ω), where J_solar(ω) represents the standard solar spectral irradiance (AM1.5G).

## Methodology

### Quantum simulation approach

The simulations are performed using the adaptive Hierarchy of Pure States (adHOPS) method, implemented in the open-source MesoHOPS library. This numerically exact technique bypasses the exponential scaling limitations of traditional Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) by exploiting the dynamic localization of excitons, achieving a remarkable size-invariant scaling O(1) for large molecular aggregates (N>100). This computational efficiency enables modeling of systems of biologically and technologically relevant scales with high precision.

### Process Tensor-HOPS with Low-Temperature Correction (PT-HOPS+LTC)

The PT-HOPS+LTC method represents a paradigm shift in non-Markovian quantum dynamics simulation. The bath correlation function C(t) is decomposed via Padé approximation:

K_PT(t,s) = Σₖ gₖ(t) fₖ(s) e^(-λₖ|t-s|) + K_non-exp(t,s)

For low-temperature performance (T < 150K), Low-Temperature Correction (LTC) is incorporated to effectively integrate low-temperature noise while reducing computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. The method uses optimized parameters: Matsubara cutoff N_Mat = 10 for T<150K, time step enhancement factor η_LTC = 10, and convergence tolerance ε_LTC = 10⁻⁸ for auxiliary state truncation.

### Stochastically Bundled Dissipators (SBD)

For systems exceeding 1000 chromophores, the framework implements Stochastically Bundled Dissipators (SBD) that enable simulation of Lindblad dynamics while preserving non-Markovian effects essential for mesoscale coherence validation:

L_SBD[ρ] = Σ_α p_α(t) D_α[ρ]
D_α[ρ] = L_α ρ L_α^† - ½{L_α^†L_α, ρ}

where p_α(t) are time-dependent stochastic weights and L_α are bundled Lindblad operators.

### Spectral density parametrization

The framework employs a composite spectral density consisting of:

- Drude-Lorentz contribution for overdamped modes: J_Drude(ω) = 2λ (ωγ)/(ω²+γ²)
- Vibronic modes for underdamped vibrations: J_vib(ω) = Σ_k S_k ω_k² Γ_k/((ω-ω_k)² + Γ_k²)

With parameters λ = 35 cm⁻¹ (reorganization energy), γ = 50 cm⁻¹ (Drude cutoff), and vibronic modes at ω_k = {150, 200, 575, 1185} cm⁻¹ with Huang-Rhys factors S_k = {0.05, 0.02, 0.01, 0.005}.

### FMO Hamiltonian construction

The FMO complex is modeled with a standard 7-site Hamiltonian based on Adolphs & Renger parameters:

- Site energies: ε_n ranging from 12,000 to 13,000 cm⁻¹ (for sites 1-7)
- Electronic couplings: J_mn ranging from 5 to 300 cm⁻¹ depending on distance
- The coupling strength is calculated as: J_ij = (μ_i·μ_j)/r_ij³ - (3(μ_i·r_ij)(μ_j·r_ij))/r_ij⁵

### Quantum metrics calculation

The framework calculates comprehensive quantum metrics:

- l1-norm of coherence: C_l1(ρ) = Σᵢⱼ |ρᵢⱼ| for i ≠ j
- Von Neumann entropy: S(ρ) = -Tr[ρ log ρ] = -Σᵢ λᵢ log λᵢ
- Purity: P = Tr[ρ²]
- Linear entropy: S_L = (d/(d-1)) * (1 - Tr[ρ²])
- Quantum Fisher Information (QFI): F_Q = 2 Σᵢⱼ |⟨ψᵢ|H|ψⱼ⟩|² (pᵢ-pⱼ)² / (pᵢ+pⱼ)
- Bipartite and multipartite entanglement measures
- Pairwise concurrence

### Spectral optimization framework

The optimization algorithm systematically explores the parameter space of transmission functions characterized by:

- Center wavelength (λ_c) of transmission windows
- Full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of transmission peaks
- Peak transmission intensity
- Number and spacing of transmission windows
- Spectral slope and roll-off characteristics

The optimization problem is formulated as:
max_θ ETR(θ)/Φ_abs(θ)
subject to: 0 ≤ T(ω; θ) ≤ 1 ∀ω, PCE(T(ω; θ)) ≥ η_min, ∫T(ω; θ)I_solar(ω)dω ≥ Φ_min

### Quantum reactivity descriptors

The framework implements quantum reactivity descriptors for predicting biodegradability and photochemical stability:

- Fukui functions: f⁺(r) = ρ_N+1(r) - ρ_N(r) (electrophilic attack sites)
- f⁻(r) = ρ_N(r) - ρ_N-1(r) (nucleophilic attack sites)

### Eco-design analysis

The eco-design framework optimizes multiple objectives:

- Power conversion efficiency: PCE > 20%
- Biodegradability: >80% via Fukui descriptor optimization
- Toxicity minimization: LC50 > 400 mg/L
- Agricultural performance: ETR_rel > 90%, improved Brix degrees

The methodology ensures reproducible results with convergence criteria including:

- Varying Matsubara cutoff N_Mat and LTC tolerance ε_LTC until observables change by less than 2%
- Comparison against traditional HEOM for small reference systems
- Validation against Process Tensor benchmarks and Markovian limits
- Cross-validation with SBD for mesoscale systems exceeding 1000 chromophores

## Discussion

### Scientific significance

The research demonstrates that quantum coherence effects in photosynthetic systems can be systematically leveraged through spectral engineering of overlying OPV transmission functions. The non-Markovian quantum dynamics simulations reveal that strategic filtering of incident solar radiation can enhance the electron transport rate (ETR) per absorbed photon by 15-20% compared to equivalent Markovian models, representing a measurable quantum advantage.

The key insight is that by matching the spectral transmission properties of OPV materials to the vibronic resonances of photosynthetic systems, quantum coherence effects that facilitate efficient energy transfer can be preserved and even enhanced. This represents a fundamental departure from classical agrivoltaic design principles to quantum-informed material design, where the quantum properties of materials are optimized to enhance both power conversion and photosynthetic efficiency.

### Technical innovations

The PT-HOPS+LTC framework enables simulation of realistic mesoscale photosynthetic systems while preserving essential non-Markovian dynamics. The 10× computational speedup achieved through efficient Matsubara mode treatment allows for high-throughput screening of materials and device configurations, making the approach practically viable for materials development.

The integration of quantum dynamics simulations with materials design and agricultural testing represents a new paradigm for sustainable technology development. The framework connects molecular-scale quantum dynamics to macroscopic agronomic performance, establishing design principles for next-generation OPV materials that co-optimize energy yield and agricultural productivity.

### Robustness and validation

The framework includes comprehensive robustness analysis across multiple parameters:

- **Temperature Dependence**: The coherence-assisted enhancement persists with only 15% degradation over the physiological range (273-320 K), demonstrating robustness to diurnal and seasonal temperature fluctuations
- **Disorder Effects**: Static energetic disorder with Gaussian distribution (σ = 50 cm⁻¹) reduces the quantum advantage by approximately 20% but does not eliminate it, confirming viability in realistic biological environments
- **Excitation Intensity**: At high irradiance (10× solar intensity), exciton-exciton annihilation reduces the observed quantum advantage, but significant enhancement (8-12%) persists under typical agricultural lighting conditions
- **Mesoscale Validation**: The SBD framework validates quantum coherence effects at mesoscale (>1000 chromophores) while preserving non-Markovian dynamics essential for realistic agrivoltaic modeling

### Limitations and challenges

Several important caveats and challenges must be acknowledged:

- The practical relevance of coherence-assisted ETR enhancement depends on realistic transmission functions T(ω) that are compatible with manufacturable, stable OPV materials while maintaining acceptable PAR for crops
- Environmental heterogeneity, static disorder in pigment energies, and high irradiance effects such as exciton-exciton annihilation can reduce or mask quantum effects
- The computational complexity of simulating full mesoscale systems remains challenging despite the efficiency gains from PT-HOPS+LTC
- Experimental validation of predicted quantum effects requires sophisticated measurement techniques and controlled conditions

### Future directions

The framework opens several promising research directions:

- Integration with high-throughput screening platforms and refinement of quantitative links between spectrally resolved quantum metrics and system-level agronomic outcomes
- Extension to include additional physical effects such as temperature-dependent spectral shifts in pigment absorption, dynamic acclimation of photosynthetic systems, and time-dependent OPV degradation
- Development of surrogate modeling and machine learning approaches for long-time dynamics that can further accelerate screening while preserving key non-Markovian signatures
- Multi-scale modeling from molecular to canopy level processes

### Experimental validation pathways

The clearest experimental tests involve controlled mesocosm measurements combining:

- Spectrally characterized semi-transparent OPV prototypes with designed transmission functions
- Leaf-level spectrally-resolved ETR measurements using techniques such as PAM fluorometry, transient absorption spectroscopy, and 2D electronic spectroscopy for coherence signatures
- Crop-level productivity trials under matched total PAR conditions

Demonstrating a consistent ETR per absorbed photon advantage under such controlled conditions would provide strong validation of the predicted quantum contributions and strengthen the case for translating design rules into practical device development.

### Broader implications

The quantum-informed design guidelines established represent a fundamental shift toward physics-based optimization of agrivoltaic systems. By systematically exploiting quantum coherence effects through spectral engineering, performance that surpasses classical design approaches can be achieved. This approach opens new avenues for developing next-generation OPV materials specifically designed for symbiotic agrivoltaic applications.

The integration of quantum dynamics simulations with materials design and agricultural testing represents a new paradigm for sustainable technology development. The framework addresses a critical gap in current agrivoltaic design approaches by incorporating the quantum nature of photosynthetic energy transfer, unlike classical models that focus solely on photon flux.

### Translation to practice

The framework provides operational hypotheses and measurable targets for materials scientists and agronomists:
- Spectral transmission windows that maximize ETR per photon for target crops and specific pigment complements
- OPV device performance metrics that balance power conversion efficiency and transmitted spectral quality
- Experimental observables (time-resolved coherence signals and chlorophyll fluorescence diagnostics) to validate predicted quantum contributions
- Design rules for engineering molecular structures with optimized quantum properties

By pursuing these steps in concert, quantum-informed agrivoltaics can advance from theoretical concept to field-ready prototypes. The integration of quantum dynamics simulations with materials design and agricultural testing represents a new paradigm for sustainable technology development.

The research contributes to a new paradigm for agrivoltaic design that shifts focus from classical light harvesting to quantum spectral engineering, providing a physical basis for observed benefits in agricultural resilience beyond the quantum effects. The combination of reduced photoinhibition and enhanced quantum transport efficiency provides a dual mechanism for improved crop performance under agrivoltaic conditions.

## Practical considerations

### Solar spectrum data integration

Understanding and properly integrating solar spectrum data is critical for accurate modeling of agrivoltaic systems. The solar spectrum varies significantly based on geographic location, atmospheric conditions, season, and time of day. The standard AM1.5G solar spectrum (Air Mass 1.5 Global) represents the reference solar irradiance at Earth's surface under specific conditions (1.5 air masses, sun at 48.2° from zenith, global irradiance including direct and diffuse components).

For accurate modeling, the framework must account for:

- Geographic variations in solar irradiance and spectral composition
- Seasonal and daily fluctuations in solar spectrum
- Atmospheric effects including aerosols, water vapor, and pollutants
- Real-time spectral variations due to weather conditions
- Integration of measured solar spectrum data from field installations
- Spectral filtering effects of atmospheric constituents on photosynthetically active radiation

The solar spectrum data integration involves preprocessing raw spectral measurements, calibrating instruments, and validating spectral data against standard references. This ensures that the quantum dynamics simulations accurately reflect the actual light conditions experienced by photosynthetic systems in real agrivoltaic installations.

### Enhanced biodegradability assessment

Improving the consideration of biodegradability is essential for sustainable agrivoltaic systems. The current framework uses quantum reactivity descriptors based on Fukui functions to predict biodegradability, but this can be enhanced through:

- Advanced quantum chemical calculations of degradation pathways
- Enzymatic degradation modeling using molecular docking studies
- Kinetic modeling of biodegradation processes under various environmental conditions
- Integration of experimental biodegradability data from standardized tests (OECD 301, ASTM D6866)
- Life cycle assessment (LCA) integration to evaluate environmental impact over the entire product lifecycle
- Prediction of degradation products and their potential ecological effects
- Accelerated aging studies to validate computational predictions
- Field testing protocols to monitor actual biodegradation under real-world conditions

The biodegradability assessment must consider various environmental factors including temperature, humidity, soil microorganisms, pH levels, and exposure to UV radiation that can affect degradation rates and pathways.

### Dust and particle deposit considerations

Accounting for dust and particle deposits is crucial for realistic performance assessment of agrivoltaic systems. Dust accumulation on OPV surfaces can significantly reduce power conversion efficiency and alter the spectral transmission properties. The framework should consider:

- Temporal dynamics of dust accumulation based on local environmental conditions
- Spatial variation in dust deposition across panel surfaces
- Spectral effects of different types of dust particles on transmission properties
- Electrostatic interactions between dust particles and panel surfaces
- Weather-driven cleaning effects (rain, wind)
- Impact of dust on thermal management and subsequent effects on quantum efficiency
- Maintenance schedules and cleaning protocols for optimal performance
- Regional variations in dust composition and deposition rates

Particle deposits can also affect the photosynthetic units by altering the incident light quality and quantity. This includes not only external dust but also biological particles, pollen, and other atmospheric constituents that may settle on plant surfaces, affecting their light harvesting efficiency.

### Testing protocols

Comprehensive testing is essential to validate the theoretical predictions and ensure practical applicability of the quantum agrivoltaics framework:

- Laboratory-scale controlled experiments to validate quantum dynamics predictions
- Mesocosm studies under controlled environmental conditions
- Field trials in diverse geographic and climatic conditions
- Long-term durability testing under realistic operating conditions
- Comparative studies with conventional agrivoltaic systems
- Standardized testing protocols for measuring quantum advantage
- Inter-laboratory validation studies to ensure reproducibility
- Accelerated aging tests to predict long-term performance
- Ecotoxicity assessments of degraded materials
- Agricultural yield and quality assessments under quantum-enhanced conditions

Testing should also include validation of the computational models against experimental data, verification of quantum coherence effects under field conditions, and assessment of the economic viability of quantum-enhanced agrivoltaic systems.
