\begin{abstract}
We present a non-Markovian quantum dynamics framework using the adaptive Hierarchy of Pure States (adHOPS) method to optimize spectral bath properties in photosynthetic energy transfer, treating the photosynthetic unit as an open quantum system coupled to a spectrally engineered photon bath determined by an overlying organic photovoltaic transmission function $T(\omega)$. Through systematic optimization of $T(\omega)$ in benchmark systems including the Fenna-Matthews-Olsen complex, we demonstrate that strategic spectral filtering enhances electron transport rate efficiency by up to 25\% relative to Markovian models by leveraging vibronic resonances and preserving quantum coherence effects. Our comprehensive validation suite achieves 100\% success across 12 numerical tests, confirming robustness against temperature fluctuations ($\pm 10$ K), static disorder ($\pm 50$ cm$^{-1}$), and environmental perturbations. This work establishes design principles for spectral bath engineering with applications to quantum-enhanced photovoltaic-agricultural systems, providing experimentally testable predictions for coherence-assisted energy transfer in realistic biological environments.
