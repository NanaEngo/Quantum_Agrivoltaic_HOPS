# Alignment with Thesis
## Anderson model foundation

Thesis reference: Background in quantum dynamics and condensed matter physics

1. DOS_jl.ipynb and DOS_py.ipynb
* Strong alignment
* **Purpose**: Density of States (DOS) calculations for quantum systems
* **Thesis connection**: Foundational understanding of electronic structure in disordered systems
* **Anderson model relevance**: DOS is central to understanding localization transitions

2. populations_jl.ipynb and populations_py.ipynb
* Moderate alignment
* **Purpose**: Population dynamics analysis
* **Thesis connection**: Quantum population evolution relevant to excitonic dynamics
* **Gap**: Needs extension to non-Markovian dynamics with environmental coupling

3. current_and_cond_py.ipynb
* Moderate alignment
* **Purpose**: Charge transport and conductance calculations
* **Thesis connection**: Relevant to charge-carrier mobilities in OPV materials (Section 3, Axis 3)
* **Gap**: Needs integration with temperature-dependent spectral densities
